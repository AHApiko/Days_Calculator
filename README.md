# Days_Calculator
The goal of this app is to assist individuals in planning maternity leave, vacations, and breastfeeding permits, providing accurate return dates and considering regional holidays.

Users can input the start date of an absence and the desired number of days or weeks to add. I added bank holiday data for both Barcelona and Madrid, allowing users to select their location and accurately calculate delivery dates.
